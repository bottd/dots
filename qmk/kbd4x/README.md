# My KBD4x Keyboard Layout

A compact 40% (12x4) ortholinear keyboard kit sold by KBDFans.

The board's microcontroller is programmed through the free/libre [QMK firmware][qmk],
which allows for a great deal of flexibility in implementing keyboard layouts.
The keymap is organized into layers that can be accessed by holding or tapping function keys.
